# dm-demo-notebooks
A place to aggregate notebooks that demonstrate functionality in data management software.

The intent is for this to transition into a fully CI'd set of notebooks.
At that point, it will move to the `lsst` organization.

The `workshops` directory is for including material intended for specific meetings.
Each subdirectory may have both an `answers` and `problems` directory.
In the existence of an `answers` directory, only that directory will be CI'd.
